# AI Challenge

Welcome! you are a super star for making it here. This is your time to shine, an opportunity to show off your skills, understanding and more importantly coding abilities üòâ. So relax, grab some coffee / whiskey (depending on time of day) and start developing on this take-home exercise.

We recommend that you implement deep learning models, using PyTorch exclusively for any models you develop

## Setup üíø

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please feel free to install any other repositories of your choice. For any deep learning implementations, please use [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/)

## Challenge Overview üí™

The challenge is split into two parts, where first part involves the implementation of a model, training it on the data and testing it. Second part involves reporting and analysis, we recommend you create a Jupyter Notebook to showcase your analysis and interpretation of your model performance. The following sections go into greater detail for each of the parts.

### Part 1: Time Series Forecasting
In this part you will:

- Implement a time series forecasting model with a transformer backbone and any prediction head design of your choice. (Implemented yourself, do not use externally implemented models) 
- Train the model on the provided dataset.
- Test the model to evaluate its performance.
- Benchmark your model to predict future trend in different time-windows, Select a time window that performs the best.

#### Datasets
There are 2 datasets we have selected for this exercise, feel free to explore and choose the one that you'd like to use.

1. **Yahoo finance stock data**: As the name suggests this is a financial time series dataset. To download it a python script has already been written for you. You can download the data via the following:

```shell
python src/utils/download_yfinance_data.py AAPL
```

This will download the stock data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 5 days ago to yesterday in 5-minute intervals, and save it to a CSV file named `AAPL_stock_data.csv`. You can also specify custom dates if needed as shown by the sample command below. Though minimum, 60 days length in 5 minute intervals is what we recommend.

```shell
python src/utils/download_yfinance_data.py AAPL --start_date 2024-05-17 --end_date 2024-05-22 --interval 5m
```

2. **CO2 Concentration Estimation**: This task utilized a publicly available dataset from Imperial College‚Äôs Carbon Capture Pilot Plant, accessible through the [orginal repositry](https://github.com/tonyzyl/CO2-Soft-sensor-for-a-carbon-capture-pilot-plant/tree/main/data/withLabel). This task requires estimating the CO2 concentration at six distinct sampling points in the absorber. For more details on the dataset and preprocessing steps, please refer to the [official notebook](https://github.com/tonyzyl/CO2-Soft-sensor-for-a-carbon-capture-pilot-plant/blob/main/Estimate_CO2_profile.ipynb). If you choose to proceed with this task, we strongly recommend using `140207_1.xlsx` as the test dataset, while the remaining files serve as the training dataset.

### Part 2: Interpretability & Reporting
In this part, you will:

- Analyse the performance of your model.
- Interpret the results and provide insights.
- Document your analysis and findings in a Jupyter Notebook, including visualizations and detailed explanations.

## What we'd like to see üôÄ
We'd like to see:

- Effective use of deep learning models, innovative learning strategies and monitoring techniques, implemented exclusively in PyTorch.
- Clear and concise code, with appropriate comments and documentation. Please share your results in a github repository with instructions on how to run and reproduce your results.
- Analysis and interpretation of your model's performance.
- Insightful visualisations that help explain your results and findings.

## What you'd be assessed on üîé

You will be assessed on:

- Model Implementation: How well you implement the time series forecasting model using PyTorch.
- Performance: The accuracy and reliability of your model on the test data.
- Analysis: The depth and clarity of your analysis in the Jupyter Notebook.
- Interpretability: How well you interpret and explain the results of your model.
- Code Quality: The readability, organization, and documentation of your code.
- Visualizations: The effectiveness of your visualizations in conveying your findings.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your work!
